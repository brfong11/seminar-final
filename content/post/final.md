When thinking back to my STEP admissions essay, I described myself as a social justice organizer who was interested in education. Over the course of the year, my perspectives on teaching, high education and social justice have been challenged but also remained the same.

First, one perspective that has changed has been transitioning from after school support staff to primary teacher of record. This year I have learned a lot about how to think carefully about crafting curriculum and classroom environments that are aligned with my mission as stated in the admission essays which was to “build an education system that works for everyone.” On this side of the fence, I have a deeper appreciation for the immense load placed on teachers. One area of growth that I have discovered this year is assessment. It has been hard for me to identify and stick with my learning objectives and also with assessing students to know if they are or are not meeting those objectives. One longer term goal I have for myself is to improve in assessment and having a clear arc in planning out the skills I want my students to grow in and checking in on students growth. A short term goal that I have is to setup a classroom environment where students are comfortable and feel challenged. I think there is a careful balance between holding students accountable for their learning and promoting joy and play in the classroom. This year exhibited my strength in that regard. My cooperating teacher on the TPE assessments rated me the highest possible rating in every category when it came to engaging students in relevant curriculum. I want to hold that strength as I enter into a less stable school environment next year.

A second way that my perspective has changed is a plummeting in my trust and respect for elite institutions. Coming in, I was skeptical about elite universities and their actual (rather than professed) commitments to “equity” or social justice. As the genocide in Gaza has unfolded and Stanford and other elite institutions with billion dollar endowments have remained complicit in the slaugther it is abundantly clear that these institutions are hedgefunds with schools attached. I have experienced deep cognitive dissonance in an education program that has us read about “abolitionist” teaching but has nothing to say when students on their own campus face police repression for protesting genocide. Furthermore, learning about the long history of racial injustice within STEP further deteriorated the social contract between myself and the program. How am I supposed to trust those who speak of “social justice” “abolitionist teaching” and “inclusion” but don’t put it into practice? Perhaps then, what has become clear is the limited nature of equity frames that are allowed in elite institutions. These frames are spoken of so fondly because they don’t actually disrupt the relationships of power. For example, as long as being “student centered” didn’t actually challenge the power of administrators, we were told we were “transformative educators.” Once Black students and others organized and took collective action for change the adjective “transformative” was immediately dropped from all communication. So then, the work started in my undergraduate career that I described in my admission essays continues. I have worked to educate myself and my students about the genocide in Palestine and use the petagogy and theory gained in this elite institution to provide students the tools to make sense of what is happening against the will of the institution. I have also worked hard to organize alongside my STEP colleagues to democratically build power for and by students. I am looking forward to working with my future students to continue to learn how history education can be used to equip students to be changemakers and challenge my own beliefs.

A final way in which my perspective has changed is in knowledge of the social sciences. I feel as though after teaching world history I have a stronger understanding of both the content and the pedagogy. There is a big gap between knowing the theory of teaching and being an effective educator in practice. I feel like I have taken a small step across that big gap this year. I feel like I know what good teaching should sound like, look like and feel like but I often feel that it is just out of my reach. One thing I found helpful this year was the affirmation and constructive feedback from my cooperating teacher. As a veteran teacher she knew what things to look out for and congratulated me on small things that I was already doing that were supporting my teachers that I didn’t recognize. She also helped me identify gaps in my pedagogy and places I needed to grow. As noted on the many observation templates, I have been working a lot on assessment and monitoring student learning with data. I came in with big visions for what I wanted my students to be able to know and do. My CT really helped me focus on what specific learning objectives I had for the day. One of the key insights was that the large unit goals need a bridge between them and the individual day to day plans. I am comfortable working day to day or really big picture, but this year I started learning how to bridge across those so that students can learn and sharpen their historical thinking skills.
